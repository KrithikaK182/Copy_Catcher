# Copy_Catcher
 It is a front-end plagiarism analyzer tool created as part of my Artificial Intelligence course.
It provides a simple and interactive interface where users can paste text, run a simulated plagiarism check, and receive an instant similarity score.

ðŸ”¹ Features-
Clean and responsive user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Text area input for pasting content.
Simulated plagiarism detection with random similarity scores (easily replaceable with a real API).
Instant results displayed in a styled result box.
Interactive feedback with alerts for empty input.

ðŸ”¹ How It Works-
User enters or pastes text into the input box.
On clicking Check for Plagiarism, the system runs a mock plagiarism detection function that generates a similarity score.
Results are displayed dynamically on the page.

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements-
Integrating with a real plagiarism detection API.
Adding support for file uploads (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
Enhancing result visualization (highlighting plagiarized text).
