# Copy_Catcher
It is a front-end plagiarism analyzer tool developed as part of my Artificial Intelligence course. The goal of this project is to design a simple yet effective user interface where users can paste text and receive a plagiarism analysis in real time. The interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
